## Hello there! ☁

Cloud Engineer with 3+ years of experience across Azure, AWS, and hybrid infrastructures, specialising in automation, identity security, and Infrastructure as Code. I transitioned into tech from a business and consulting background, which gives me a unique ability to translate complex technical challenges into clear, business-aligned solutions.

At the Royal Opera House, I’ve deployed and automated cloud environments, improved infrastructure reliability, strengthened cloud security, and reduced operational overhead using Terraform, PowerShell, Azure Automation, Logic Apps, and modern identity governance. My work has supported 500+ endpoints, multi-cloud environments, large-scale migrations, and automation initiatives that reduced both costs and manual effort.

I’m particularly focused on cloud automation, operational efficiency, and scalable architecture—while expanding my skills in Python, data analysis, and applied machine learning to move toward AI-augmented cloud engineering.

I’m passionate about solving real problems through automation, building secure and resilient systems, and working with teams to deliver cloud solutions that improve performance, reduce friction, and drive meaningful business outcomes.
